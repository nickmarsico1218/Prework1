# <SMU Coding Bootcamp Study Guide>

## Description

As someone new to the coding world I wanted to build a guide to help myself and others with initial understnding of basic coding language, outlines and syntax. While building this project I hoped to gain a better framework of understanding how HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript would be used in my upcoming carrer change as a developer. As a very new developer my hope is that this guide will be something that I may add to thoughtout the bootcamp course to help guide me and others on which topic should be studied. While working on this study guide I was able to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript; in hopes to be able to build from that knowledge and be able to apply this understanding to the course.
